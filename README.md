# Sales Dashboard Application

## Overview
This project is an interactive web-based sales dashboard built using **Dash** and **Plotly** in Python. It visualizes sales data from a CSV file (`data.csv`) through four dynamic charts and a data table:
- **Line Chart**: Displays monthly sales trends across selected years.
- **Bar Chart**: Shows sales by year and region for a selected month.
- **Pie Chart**: Illustrates the distribution of sales by region for a selected month and year(s).
- **Scatter Chart**: Visualizes the relationship between units sold and profit, with points sized by revenue and colored by region.
- **Data Table**: Displays raw sales data filtered by selected year(s) and month.

The dashboard supports multiple languages (Arabic and English), allows exporting charts as PNG images, and provides a responsive user interface using Bootstrap.

## Features
- Interactive dropdowns to filter data by year, month, and language.
- Four dynamic charts (line, bar, pie, and scatter) for comprehensive data visualization.
